GestureRecognizer
=================

A simple recognizer for spatial gestures - currently uses Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to recognize two predefined gestures

*Note*
Uploads a copy accelerometer data to an online database for future reference

*Future improvements*
- multiple gestures
- user-defined gestures
- more sophisticated algorithms
